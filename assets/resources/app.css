/**

  In CSS, the order of the rules in your stylesheet decides which declaration wins when two selectors have the same specificity:

     .btn {
        background: blue;
        ...
     }
     .bg-black {
         background: black;
     }

  Here, both buttons will be black since .bg-black comes after .btn in the CSS:

     <button class="btn bg-black">...</button>
     <button class="bg-black btn">...</button>

  To manage this, Tailwind organizes the styles it generates into three different “layers” — a concept popularized by ITCSS.

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/**
  Custom CSS: for customizing theme see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#customizing-your-theme
  The base layer is for things like reset rules or default styles applied to plain HTML elements.
 */
@layer base {}

/**
 * The components layer is for class-based styles that you want to be able to override with utilities.
 */
@layer components {}

/**
 * The utilities layer is for small, single-purpose classes that should always take precedence over any other styles.
 */
@layer utilities {}
